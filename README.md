# mudbot
Perl script written in 2007 which plays a MUD character inside the Isengard Mordor server. Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) were text-based games from the 90's which allowed many players to connect and interact with each other in an universe akin to the famous ZORK text adventure by Infocom. A player could walk around the virtual world and interact with people, objects, and non-playing characters (NPC). By killing monsters one can accumulate experience and level up becoming an even more powerful character. Leveling takes time and is laboriously repetitive. In order to speed-up the leveling process I wrote this script that runs 24/7 killing small mobs just like in one of the scenes from the South Park in the episode: World of Warcraft 'Live to Win'.
